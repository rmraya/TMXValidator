# TMXValidator

![alt text](https://maxprograms.com/images/Red_squares.png "TMXValidator Icon")

Check the validity of your TMX documents on Windows, Linux or macOS with TMXValidator.

Most CAT (Computer Aided Translation) tools rely on TMX (Translation Memory eXchange) standard to exchange translation memory data. Unfortunately, some tools produce files that are not valid and others do not accept correctly formatted TMX documents.

TMXValidator validates your documents against the TMX DTD and also verifies that they comply with the requirements described in the TMX specifications.

TMXValidator supports TMX versions 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4.

The source code of TMXValidator was originally published on SourceForge at [https://sourceforge.net/p/tmxvalidator/code](https://sourceforge.net/p/tmxvalidator/code). The original version was written in Java and loaded the TMX file into memory for validation, limiting support for very large files.

TMXValidator has since been rewritten entirely in TypeScript. It uses a SAX-based streaming parser with full support for DTD validation ([TypesXML](https://maxprograms.com/products/typesxml.html)) and has no file size limitation.
